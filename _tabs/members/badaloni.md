I am a PhD Student at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, where I'm part of the Heinz Nixdorf Research Group for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts, since March 2023.

I finshed my University Degree in Computer Science ("Licenciatura en Ciencias de la Computación") at the [National University of Rosario](https://dcc.fceia.unr.edu.ar/), in Argentina, in February 2022. My thesis was in game theory, studying the Fictitious Play algorithm for finding Nash equilibria.

My line of research focuses on the expresivity of programming languages for smart contracts on non-turing-complete platforms. I'm currently working on extensions and portability for the BitML language.

I'm also interested in applications of smart contracts to the administration of collective commons, cooperatives, planned economies and any other ways of building tools for solidarity and horizontal collaboration without intermediaries.
