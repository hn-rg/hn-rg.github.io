Since May 2021, I am a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy. Before, I completed my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Vienna under the supervision of [Matteo Maffei](https://secpriv.wien/team/306636-matteo-maffei/). 

In my research, I aim to develop solutions for the meaningful, secure, resource-saving, and privacy-preserving usage of blockchain technologies. I am particularly interested in approaches that provide users with reliable guarantees for the security of the blockchain-based applications that they are interacting with (e.g., smart contracts or layer-2 protocols).

You can find a list of my publications in my [GoogleScholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1pngbhYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
