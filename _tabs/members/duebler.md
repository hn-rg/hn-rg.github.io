Since January 2023 I have been a PhD Student at the Heinz Nixdorf Research Group for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts at MPI-SP.
I am interested in the theoretical foundations for blockchain-based distributed applications. With a strong background in mathematics, I am especially concerned with provable security guarantees.

Prior to MPI-SP, I completed my Bachelor's (2020) and Master's Degree (2022) in Mathematics at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). 
Besides my university education, I gained profound practical experience in algorithm design and data science by working at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering](https://www.isst.fraunhofer.de/en.html) as a working student.
