title: Atomic Swap Graphs
type: project

In this project we develop a framework to safely enable multi-party asset swaps across multiple blockchain based systems. 
The current state has been presented at [FCS23](https://squera.github.io/fcs23/) in the form of a workshop paper. 

## Abstract
Atomic swaps enable two users holding assets in different cryptocurrencies to safely exchange them without relying on a trusted third party. Recent works have extended this idea to swap graphs, describing exchanges of assets between multiple users that should be executed atomically. In this work, we observe that the notion of swap graphs can be generalized to describe a broader class of interesting blockchain protocols, which rely on atomic transaction execution. Following this observation, we broaden the class of swap graphs considered in prior work and define a new protocol for securely realizing such graphs from more general primitives. The resulting class of graphs is expressive enough to capture existing multi-party blockchain protocols such as multi-hop payments and crowdfunding.
